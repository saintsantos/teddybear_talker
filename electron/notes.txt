/* Some notes on what this application needs to do in order to be funcional */

Some sort of schedular that can be sent to the pi for the bear to respond to.

A way to record audio and upload that audio to the bear.
A way to add import audio to the software and send that audio to the bear. 
	The easiset way to do both of these is to only have one function that
	sends the audio files to the bear, and have the in house recording software
	saved in a similar way to the imported files.
